# slide: LaTeX package to create free form slides

This package allows to create free form slides with boxes placed on a grid.
This allows more flexible slides similar compared to LaTeX beamer.
Sequential unconvering of elements is supported.
A compiler script is provided which compiles each slide separately, avoiding long compile times this way.

## Example

See the file `example.tex`. Each slide is compiled separately using `compile.pl example.tex`.
